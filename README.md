This folder contains the code for my Scientific Machine Learning projects in the Julia language. Scientific Machine Learning is an emerging area of data-driven sciences which aims to combine the power of Deep Learning with accurate Physics based equations. 
Key Concepts involved are:

-Physics Informed Neuaral Networks (PINNs)

-Nueral ODEs

-Universal Differential equations.
